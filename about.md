This website houses a publicly available database providing interactive access to the (re)analysis of RNA-Seq data presented in published papers. The resource is powered by [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/), [sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/), the [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home) workflow management syste and the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) web application framework. GitHub repositories with the source code for the project are located at {% include icon-github.html %}[bears_analysis](https://github.com/pachterlab/bears_analyses) and {% include icon-github.html %}[lair](https://github.com/pachterlab/lair).

The [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) page contains a list of papers and links to their sleuth-based analysis sites. Each data in each publication is processed according to a meta-data file located at {% include icon-github.html %}[bears_analysis\
](https://github.com/pachterlab/bears_analyses) with data automatically downloaded from the [Short Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).


This project was developed by Harold Pimentel, Pascal Sturmfels and Lior Pachter with help from the [Pachter Lab](http://pachterlab.github.io)  .
