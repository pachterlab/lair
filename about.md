Welcome to the bear's lair!
In the future, this website will house a publicly available
database of RNA-seq papers combined with their (re-)analysis performed
using [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) and [Sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/).

For now though, the website is under construction. You can check out the github
for this project at {% include icon-github.html %}[bears_analysis](https://github.com/pachterlab/bears_analyses).

At the moment, the [Papers](/papers) page contains a basic list of papers
we are planning to analyze, as well as the meta-data files about those
experiments pulled from the [Short Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
