Welcome to the bear's lair!
This website houses a publicly available
database of RNA-seq papers combined with their (re-)analysis performed
using [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) and [sleuth](http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/).

You can check out the GitHub for this project at {% include icon-github.html %}[bears_analysis](https://github.com/pachterlab/bears_analyses).

The [Papers](/papers) page contains a basic list of papers
and links to their analysis as well as the meta-data files about those
experiments pulled from the [Short Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
