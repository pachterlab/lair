- I'd like to see an analysis of the data from a paper on your site, can you do it for me? 
  - We're happy to add analyses to the site. Please let us know what data/paper you'd like to see included according to the instructions provided on our [contact](http://pachterlab.github.io/lair/contact/) page. 

- I am interested in one of the analyses on your site, but would like to see a different test performed. Can you do this for me? 
  - We plan to increase the interactivity of the site in the future allowing users to better interact with the data. For now we'll appreciate hearing about your request on our [Google user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kallisto-sleuth-users). Please note that we also plan many improvements to the sleuth Shiny server in the coming months, for example the addition of gene level analysis to the results.

- I looked at your analysis of the data from my paper and it's wrong!
  - The automation of analysis of data from published papers was complicated by numerous issues: inconsistency of metadata in the short read archive, problems with the reads in some samples, and almost surely confusion on our part about some of the methodology in the papers we read. We'll be very happy to fix any mistakes and welcome feedback about any of the analyses we have posted.

- I would like you to add an analysis of a dataset that is not in the short read archive. Can you do it?
  - We're currently insisting that all analyzed data be available on the short read archive, and that a publication about the data be available ("publication" defined as an associated doi). These requirements have made it easier for us to automate our workflow. We plan to relax this requirements in the future.
